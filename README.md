# Project Better - RPA for Hospitality

Welcome to "Project Better", a project I developed as a student in the RPA Bootcamp at Coding Dojo under the sponsorship of SDA (Saudi Digital Academy). This project is an implementation of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in the hospitality industry, specifically for hotel guest services. 

## Overview

"Project Better" employs an intelligent bot capable of performing three key functions:

1. **Check-in for new guests:** The bot efficiently manages the complete check-in process for new guests.

2. **Inquiry for existing guests:** It handles inquiries from guests, delivering quick and personalized responses about guest status.

3. **Guest check-out:** It oversees the check-out process, ensuring a seamless experience for guests.

This bot helps identify repeat guests with ease, thus helping to provide a more personalized experience.

## Benefits of Automation

"Project Better" offers several benefits, including:

- **Personalized Guest Experience:** Through identifying repeat guests, the bot can offer more personalized services.

- **Easier Access to Guest Information:** The bot provides quick and easy access to guest information, which can facilitate the provision of efficient services.

- **Time-saving:** The automation of these processes significantly reduces the time taken compared to manual tasks, improving overall productivity.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone this GitHub repository.
2. Open the project in UiPath.
3. Run the bot to experience its functionality!

Detailed flowcharts of the processes are provided in the included PDF file, and the PowerPoint presentation provides a comprehensive overview of the project.

## Conclusion

Through "Project Better", I aim to showcase the potential of RPA in revolutionizing the hospitality industry by simplifying hotel staff's tasks and enhancing the guest experience. I welcome your interest in this project and look forward to your contributions and feedback.
